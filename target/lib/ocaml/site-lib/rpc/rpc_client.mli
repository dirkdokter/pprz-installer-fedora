(** RPC clients *)

(** This module implements an RPC client, i.e. provides means to connect
 * to an RPC service and call remote procedures.
 * In general, this module works in an asynchronous way and is implemented
 * event-driven. All events are handled by an event queue of type
 * Unixqueue.t that must already exist and to which this module adds its
 * own event handlers and event resources. This means that this module
 * can co-exist with other services and share the same event queue with
 * them.
 *
 * You can push several procedure calls on the event queue at once.
 * The queue serves then as a pipeline; the calls are sent to the
 * server as long as the server accepts new calls. Replies are received
 * in any order, and the return values of the remote procedures are
 * delivered using a callback function.
 *
 * You can set timeouts and force automatic retransmission if you want
 * this; these features are enabled by default if the underlying transport
 * mechanism is UDP. Timeouts and other exceptions are delivered to the
 * callback functions, too.
 *
 * The whole mechanism is designed to allow maximum parallelism without
 * needing to use the multi-threading features of O'Caml. Especially,
 * the following parallelisms can be done:
 * - Call several procedures of the same server in parallel. Note that
 *   this does not necessarily mean that the procedures are run in
 *   parallel since the server is free to decide whether to work
 *   in a synchronous or asynchronous way.
 * - Call several procedures of different servers in parallel. To do so,
 *   simply add several RPC clients to the same event queue.
 * - Call a procedure and do something completely different in the
 *   background; this works well as long as the other task can be
 *   programmed using file descriptor events, too.
 *
 * However, there are still some restrictions concerning asynchronous
 * calls. Some of them will be removed in the future, but others are
 * difficult to tackle:
 * - Authentication methods requiring RPC calls or other network services are
 *   performed in an synchronous way, too.
 * - Name service lookups are synchronous, too.

(* The following exceptions are delivered to the callback function: *)

exception Message_lost
  (** got EOF when some pending procedure calls were not replied or even sent *)

exception Message_timeout
  (** After all retransmissions, there was still no reply *)

exception Response_dropped
  (** Drop reason: The response exceeded the configured maximum message size *)

exception Communication_error of exn
  (** an I/O error happened *)

exception Client_is_down
  (** The RPC call cannot be performed because the client has been shut down
   * in the meantime. You can get this exception if you begin a new call,
   * but the connection is closed now.
   *)

exception Keep_call
  (** This exception can be raised by the callback function that is invoked
   * when the server response arrives. It causes that the RPC call record
   * is kept in the housekeeping structure of the client. If the server
   * sends another response, the callback function will be invoked again.
   * I.e. one call can be replied several times (server-driven batching).
   *)

exception Unbound_exception of exn
  (** This exception can be raised by the callback function that is invoked
   * when the server response arrives. It simply causes that the inner
   * exception bypasses the exception handler, and falls through to the 
   * caller of [Unixqueue.run]. This is useful to jump out of the running RPC
   * routines.

   * Opens a connection to the server specified by [mode2].
   * The server is assumed to implement an RPC program as specified by
   * the [Rpc_program.t] argument. (You can override the program and version
   * numbers stored in this argument by the optional parameters
   * [program_number] and [version_number]. If you need to call several
   * programs/versions with the same client, use [unbound_create] instead.)
   *
   * All communication to the server is handled using the given queue

   * If the protocol is Udp, a datagram-oriented communication style is
   * used. This works only for Internet UDP sockets because these are
   * bidirectional (Unix domain sockets are unidirectional and do not
   * work). For Udp, there is a timeout of 15 seconds and a maximum
   * of 3 retransmissions (i.e. a total of 4 transmission trials).
   * For connected UDP sockets there is a limit of 64K per message

   *
   * Values of [retransmissions > 0] are semantically only valid if the
   * called procedures are idempotent, i.e. invoking them several times
   * with the same values has the same effect as only one invocation.
   * Positive values for [retransmissions] should only be used for Udp-style
   * communication.
   *
   * The timeout value determines how long the client waits until the
   * next retransmission is done, or, if no more retransmissions are
   * permitted, a [Message_timeout] exception is delivered to the receiving
   * callback function. A [timeout] value of 0.0 means immediate timeout
   * (see next paragraph). A negative [timeout] value means 'no timeout'.
   * Positive [timeout] values are possible for both Udp and Tcp connections.
   * Timeout values are measured in seconds.
   *
   * There is a special application for the timeout value 0.0: If you
   * don't expect an answer from the server at all ("batch mode"), this
   * timeout value will cause that the message handler will get
   * a [Message_timeout] exception immediately. You should ignore this
   * exception for batch mode. The positive effect from the timeout is that
   * the internal management routines will remove the remote call from
   * the list of pending calls such that this list will not become too long.
   * (You can get a similar effect by calling [set_batch_call], however.)
   *
   * Note that the meaning of timeouts for TCP connections is unclear.
   * The TCP stream may be in an undefined state. Because of this, the
   * client does not make any attempt to clean the state up for TCP.
   * The user is advised to shut down the client, and reconnect.
   *
   * There is another subtle difference between UDP and TCP. For UDP,
   * the timer is started when the packet is sent. For TCP, however,
   * the timer is already started when the RPC call is added to the
   * queue, i.e. much earlier. This means that the time for connecting
   * to the remote service is also bound by the timeout. The rationale
   * is that TCP timeouts are usually set to catch total service failures
   * rather than packet losses, and this behaviour is best for this purpose.

    * for using the client in conjunction with unconnected UDP sockets.
    * For connected sockets, the destination of datagrams is implicitly
    * given. For unconnected sockets, one has to set the destination
    * explicitly. Do so by calling [set_dgram_destination] with
    * [Some addr] as [addr_opt] argument before calling.
    * Passing [None] as [addr_opt] removes the explicit destination again.
    * Note that unconnected sockets differ from connected sockets also in
    * the relaxation that they can receive messages from any IP address,

   * Shutdowns can be complex operations. For this reason, this function
   * implements some magic that is usually the right thing, but may also
   * be wrong:

   *    however, which may lead to side effects and infinite delay. This can
  *     be wrong.
   *  - If called from within the event loop, the shutdown is only triggered
   *    but not immediately done. When the caller returns to the event loop
   *    the shutdown will be performed. This case is problematic when you
   *    pass the file descriptor explicitly with [Descriptor] to the client.

   * The server is assumed to implement an RPC program as specified by
   * the [Rpc_program.t] argument. (You can override the program and version
   * numbers stored in this argument by the optional parameters
   * [program_number] and [version_number].)
   *
   * All communication to the server is handled using the given queue
   * [Unixqueue.event_system].
   *
   * If the protocol is Tcp, the communication will be handled stream-
   * oriented. In this case, no timeout is detected and no retransmissions
   * are done.
   *
   * If the protocol is Udp, a datagram-oriented communication style is
   * used. This works only for Internet UDP sockets because these are
   * bidirectional (Unix domain sockets are unidirectional and do not
   * work). For Udp, there is a timeout of 15 seconds and a maximum
   * of 3 retransmissions (i.e. a total of 4 transmission trials).
   *
   * Unlike [create2], servers made with [create] always use blocking
   * [connect] for backwards compatibility.
   *
   * @deprecated This function should not be used any more in new programs.
