(* FastCGI protocol (version 1) according to the specification found
   at http://www.fastcgi.com/devkit/doc/fcgi-spec.html
*)
(** There is a bug in mod_fastcgi with the following symptom:

    "If the answer to a request to the server has more than 8192 Bytes
    and less then about 16000 Bytes of payload, the HTTP header is not
    counted, the request will fail with an idle timeout.  But the FCGI
    server has delivered the complete response to the apache server in
    time."

    A fix is to close the socket at the end of the request -- in
    addition the spec. sec. 3.5 says "A simple application gets a
    significant performance boost by closing the transport connection
    when it has finished writing its response."

    This of course disallows the multiplexing of requests.  As moreover
    this library will deal with 1 request at a time, there is no much
    point in queuing the packets for the other requests, better
    DISALLOW MULTIPLEXING.

    TODO: If the need is felt, a multithreaded connector running
    requests in separated threads makes sense.

(* In the following, we stack several netchannels. The goal is to reduce
 * the number of system calls (Unix.write) as much as possible. These
 * calls are much more expensive than the additional overhead of stacking.
 *
 * In particular, the stack looks as follows:
 *
 * - TOP: user_out_channel
 *   Data written to this channel is encoded as fcgi packet. No buffer.
 *   Maybe it would be better to have another buffer before the encoding
 *   happens to make the packets as large as possible. However, we usually
 *   have already a transactional buffer on top of the user_out_channel.
 * - fcgi_out_channel
 *   Data written to this channel must already be formatted as fcgi packets.
 *   Auxiliary methods generate such packets from user data. No buffer.
 * - Netchannels.buffered_raw_out_channel
 *   Implements a buffer.
 * - prim_out_channel
 *   Only purpose is to disable close_out. The file descriptor is not
 *   closed by the channel stack
 * - BOTTOM: Netchannels.output_descr
 *   Maps channel methods to system calls. No buffer.
 *
 * For the input direction stacking is similar.
