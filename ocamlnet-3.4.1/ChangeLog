	transport type

	* Netfs: new methods read_file and write_file, for file-based
	downloads and uploads, respectively.

	* Netfs: new method cancel to stop an upload prematurely

	* Http_fs, Ftp_fs: new method translate to get the URL for a file
	operation

	* Ftp_fs: the get_password and get_account functions take the user

2011-08-23  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Build fixes for Ocaml-3.11. There were some regressions.

	  (new directives NetcgiRequire et al)

2011-08-05  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Released: ocamlnet-3.3.7

2011-08-03  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Netplex: new workload_hook. It is called whenever a
	  connection is accepted or terminated.

	* Netplex: new config conn_limit to set the maximum number
	  of connections a container can accept

	* Netplex: new config gc_when_idle to run Gc.full_major
	  when the container is idle for some time

	* Reducing memory consumption (Uq_io and users such as
	  Http_client, Netplex, Rpc) by recycling bigarray buffers
	  more quickly

	* New admin messages netplex.mem.major, netplex.mem.compact,
	  netplex.mem.pools, netplex.mem.stats

	* Docs netplex_admin.txt

2011-07-29  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Shell: calling subprograms did not work when multi-threading
	  was enabled because of a caml_leave_blocking_section
	  without prior caml_enter_blocking_section. This is fixed.

	* Uq_ssl: Changed the method of closing SSL tunnels. Before,
	  a close-notify SSL message was sent, and also expected by the
	  peer before the connection was closed on TCP level. Now,
	  we half-close the TCP connection immediately after sending
	  close-notify. This seems to fix some SSL sessions where the
	  server ignores close-notify, and only reacts on TCP closes.
	  This method of closing seems to be ok with the standard,
	  which is apparently not very precise on SSL closures.

	* Released: Ocamlnet-3.3.6

2011-07-20  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Fix filter in Rpc_server: they are no longer accidentally reset for
          longer TCP messages

	  responds without awaiting the request

	* Mimestring: reimplementing the MIME scanner w/o regexps. Also new
          string processing functions for iterating over lines.

        * Nethttpd: banning all regexps in message parsing that could cause
          stack overflows 

	* Nethttpd: Returning better Content-Encoding for statically served 
	  files. In particular, the encoding of compressed files is taken
	  into account

	* Released: Ocamlnet-3.3.5
	
2011-07-12  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Shell_sys: Fixing descriptor assignments (avoiding EBADF
	  errors)

	* Netplex: support for TCP_NODELAY in servers
	
	* Released: Ocamlnet-3.3.4

2011-06-24  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Rpc_client: fix for GSS-API authentication how
	  exceptions are passed back to the caller, avoiding
	  double callbacks

	* Packing error for Netglob_lex.

2011-06-16  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Rpc_client: fix when trying several authentication methods:

	  heaps. Also contains a tutorial now.

2011-03-07  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Netnumber: better successor of Rtypes, with both big-endian
	  and little-endian support. Rtypes is still available as
	  legacy module

	* Xdr, Xdr_mstring, Rtypes: have been moved to the "netstring"
	  library part

	* Adding support for GSS-API: The generic interface is defined in
	  Netgssapi. ONC-RPC support can be found in Rpc_auth_gssapi.

	* Nethttpd: Fixing a bug in Nethttpd_services that prevents in

2007-05-06  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@gerd-stolpmann.de>

	* Fix: For Unix domain sockets, getsockname and getpeername
	  may return EAFNOSUPPORT. This code is generated by the
	  OCaml runtime when it sees an address it does not support.
	  We handle this case as a connected socket with inaccessible
	  address. The problem was reported to happen for MacOS.

	* Fix: IPv6 is now supported by most functionality. Exception
	  is the SOCKS stuff.
